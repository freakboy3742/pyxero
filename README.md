PyXero is a Python API for accessing the REST API provided by the [Xero](https://developer.xero.com)
accounting tool. It allows access to both Public, Private and Partner applications.

## Quickstart:

Install this library using the python package manager:

```
pip install pyxero
```

### Using OAuth2 Credentials

OAuth2 is an open standard authorization protocol that allows users to
provide specific permissions to apps that want to use their account. OAuth2
authentication is performed using *tokens* that are obtained using an API;
these tokens are then provided with each subsequent request.

OAuth2 tokens have a 30 minute expiry, but can be swapped for a new token at any
time. Xero documentation on the OAuth2 process can be found
[here](https://developer.xero.com/documentation/oauth2/overview/). The procedure
for creating and authenticating credentials is as follows *(with a Django
example at the end)*:

 1) [Register your app](https://developer.xero.com/myapps) with Xero, using a
    redirect URI which will be served by your app in order to complete the
    authorisation e.g. `https://mysite.com/oauth/xero/callback/`. See step 3 for
    an example of what your app should do. Generate a Client Secret, then store
    it and the Client Id somewhere that your app can access them, such as a
    config file.

 2) Construct an `OAuth2Credentials` instance using the details from the first
    step.
    ```python
    >>> from xero.auth import OAuth2Credentials
    >>>
    >>> credentials = OAuth2Credentials(client_id, client_secret,
    >>>                                 callback_uri=callback_uri)
    ```
    If necessary pass in a list of scopes to define the scopes required by your
    app. E.g. if write access is required to transactions and payroll employees:

    ```python
    >>> from xero.constants import XeroScopes
    >>>
    >>> my_scope = [XeroScopes.ACCOUNTING_TRANSACTIONS,
    >>>             XeroScopes.PAYROLL_EMPLOYEES]
    >>> credentials = OAuth2Credentials(client_id, client_secret, scope=my_scope
    >>>                                 callback_uri=callback_uri)
    ```
    The default scopes are `['offline_access', 'accounting.transactions.read',
    'accounting.contacts.read']`. `offline_access` is required in order for
    tokens to be refreshable. For more details on scopes see Xero's
    [documentation]( https://developer.xero.com/documentation/oauth2/scopes).

 3) Generate a Xero authorisation url which the user can visit to complete
    authorisation. Then store the state of the credentials object and redirect
    the user to the url in their browser.
    ```python
    >>> authorisation_url = credentials.generate_url()
    >>>
    >>> # Now store credentials.state somewhere accessible, e.g a cache
    >>> mycache['xero_creds'] = credentials.state
    >>>
    >>> # then redirect the user to authorisation_url
    ...
    ```
    The callback URI should be the redirect URI you used in step 1.

 4) After authorization the user will be redirected from Xero to the
    callback URI provided in step 1, along with a querystring containing the
    authentication secret. When your app processes this request, it should pass
    the full URI including querystring to `verify()`:
    ```python
    >>> # Recreate the credentials object
    >>> credentials = OAuth2Credentials(**mycache['xero_creds'])
    >>>
    >>> # Get the full redirect uri from the request including querystring
    >>> # e.g. request_uri = 'https://mysite.com/oauth/xero/callback/?code=0123456789&scope=openid%20profile&state=87784234sdf5ds8ad546a8sd545ss6'
    >>>
    >>> credentials.verify(request_uri)
    ```
    A token will be fetched from Xero and saved as `credentials.token`. If the
    credentials object needs to be created again either dump the whole object
    using:
    ```python
    >>> cred_state = credentials.state
    >>> ...
    >>> new_creds = OAuth2Credentials(**cred_state)
    ```
    or just use the client_id, client_secret and token (and optionally scopes
    and tenant_id):
    ```python
    >>> token = credentials.token
    >>> ...
    >>> new_creds = OAuth2Credentials(client_id, client_secret, token=token)
    ```

 5) Now the credentials may be used to authorize a Xero session. As OAuth2
    allows authentication for multiple Xero Organisations, it is necessary to
    set the tenant_id against which the xero client's queries will run.
    ```python
    >>> from xero import Xero
    >>> # Use the first xero organisation (tenant) permitted
    >>> credentials.set_default_tenant()
    >>> xero = Xero(credentials)
    >>> xero.contacts.all()
    >>> ...
    ```
    If the scopes supplied in Step 2 did not require access to organisations
    (e.g. when only requesting scopes for single sign) it will not be
    possible to make requests with the Xero API and `set_default_tenant()` will
    raise an exception.

    To pick from multiple possible Xero organisations the `tenant_id` may be set
    explicitly:
    ```python
    >>> tenants = credentials.get_tenants()
    >>> credentials.tenant_id = tenants[1]['tenantId']
    >>> xero = Xero(credentials)
    ```
    `OAuth2Credentials.__init__()` accepts `tenant_id` as a keyword argument.

 6) When using the API over an extended period, you will need to exchange tokens
    when they expire. If a refresh token is available, it can be used to
    generate a new token:
    ```python
    >>> if credentials.expired():
    >>>     credentials.refresh()
    >>>     # Then store the new credentials or token somewhere for future use:
    >>>     cred_state = credentials.state
    >>>     # or
    >>>     new_token = credentials.token

    **Important**: ``credentials.state`` changes after a token swap. Be sure to
    persist the new state.

    ```
 #### Django OAuth2 App Example
 This example shows authorisation, automatic token refreshing and API use in
 a Django app which has read/write access to contacts and transactions. If the
 cache used is cleared on server restart, the token will be lost and
 verification will have to take place again.

 ```python
from django.http import HttpResponseRedirect
from django.core.cache import caches

from xero import Xero
from xero.auth import OAuth2Credentials
from xero.constants import XeroScopes

def start_xero_auth_view(request):
    # Get client_id, client_secret from config file or settings then
    credentials = OAuth2Credentials(
        client_id, client_secret, callback_uri=callback_uri,
        scope=[XeroScopes.OFFLINE_ACCESS, XeroScopes.ACCOUNTING_CONTACTS,
               XeroScopes.ACCOUNTING_TRANSACTIONS]
    )
    authorization_url = credentials.generate_url()
    caches['mycache'].set('xero_creds', credentials.state)
    return HttpResponseRedirect(authorization_url)

def process_callback_view(request):
    cred_state = caches['mycache'].get('xero_creds')
    credentials = OAuth2Credentials(**cred_state)
    auth_secret = request.build_absolute_uri()
    credentials.verify(auth_secret)
    credentials.set_default_tenant()
    caches['mycache'].set('xero_creds', credentials.state)

def some_view_which_calls_xero(request):
    cred_state = caches['mycache'].get('xero_creds')
    credentials = OAuth2Credentials(**cred_state)
    if credentials.expired():
        credentials.refresh()
        caches['mycache'].set('xero_creds', credentials.state)
    xero = Xero(credentials)

    contacts = xero.contacts.all()
    ...
 ```

### Using PKCE Credentials

PKCE is an alternative flow for providing authentication via OAuth2. It works
largely the same as the standard OAuth2 mechanism, but unlike the normal flow is
designed to work with applications which cannot keep private keys secure, such
as desktop, mobile or single page apps where such secrets could be extracted. A
client ID is still required.

As elsewhere, OAuth2 tokens have a 30 minute expiry, but can be only swapped for
a new token if the `offline_access` scope is requested.

Xero documentation on the PKCE flow can be found
[here](https://developer.xero.com/documentation/guides/oauth2/pkce-flow). The
procedure for creating and authenticating credentials is as follows *(with a CLI
example at the end)*:

 1) [Register your app](https://developer.xero.com/myapps) with Xero, using a
    redirect URI which will be served by your app in order to complete the
    authorisation e.g. `http://localhost:<port>/callback/`. You can chose any
    port, and can pass it to the credentials object on construction, allow with
    the the Client Id you are provided with.

 2) Construct an `OAuth2Credentials` instance using the details from the first
    step.

    ```python
    >>> from xero.auth import OAuth2Credentials
    >>>
    >>> credentials = OAuth2PKCECredentials(client_id,   port=my_port)
    ```

    If necessary, pass in a list of scopes to define the scopes required by
    your app. E.g. if write access is required to transactions and payroll
    employees:

    ```python
    >>> from xero.constants import XeroScopes
    >>>
    >>> my_scope = [XeroScopes.ACCOUNTING_TRANSACTIONS,
    >>>             XeroScopes.PAYROLL_EMPLOYEES]
    >>> credentials = OAuth2Credentials(client_id, scope=my_scope
    >>>                                 port=my_port)
    ```

    The default scopes are `['offline_access', 'accounting.transactions.read',
    'accounting.contacts.read']`. `offline_access` is required in order for
    tokens to be refreshable. For more details on scopes see [Xero's
    documentation on oAuth2
    scopes](https://developer.xero.com/documentation/oauth2/scopes).

 3) Call `credentials.logon()` . This will open a browser window, an visit
    a Xero authentication page.

    ```python
    >>> credentials.logon()
    ```

    The Authenticator will also start a local webserver on the provided port.
    This webserver will be used to collect the tokens that Xero returns.

    The default `PCKEAuthReceiver` class has no response pages defined so the
    browser will show an error, on empty page for all transactions. But the
    application is now authorised and will continue. If you wish you can
    override the `send_access_ok()` method, and the `send_error_page()` method
    to create a more userfriendly experience.

    In either case once the callback url has been visited the local server will
    shutdown.

 4) You can now continue as per the normal OAuth2 flow. Now the credentials may
    be used to authorize a Xero session. As OAuth2 allows authentication for
    multiple Xero Organisations, it is necessary to set the tenant_id against
    which the xero client's queries will run.

    ```python
    >>> from xero import Xero
    >>> # Use the first xero organisation (tenant) permitted
    >>> credentials.set_default_tenant()
    >>> xero = Xero(credentials)
    >>> xero.contacts.all()
    >>> ...
    ```
    If the scopes supplied in Step 2 did not require access to organisations
    (e.g. when only requesting scopes for single sign) it will not be possible
    to make requests with the Xero API and `set_default_tenant()` will raise an
    exception.

    To pick from multiple possible Xero organisations the `tenant_id` may be set
    explicitly:

    ```python
    >>> tenants = credentials.get_tenants()
    >>> credentials.tenant_id = tenants[1]['tenantId']
    >>> xero = Xero(credentials)
    ```
    `OAuth2Credentials.__init__()` accepts `tenant_id` as a keyword argument.

 5) When using the API over an extended period, you will need to exchange tokens
    when they expire. If a refresh token is available, it can be used to
    generate a new token:

    ```python
    >>> if credentials.expired():
    >>>     credentials.refresh()
    >>>     # Then store the new credentials or token somewhere for future use:
    >>>     cred_state = credentials.state
    >>>     # or
    >>>     new_token = credentials.token

    **Important**: ``credentials.state`` changes after a token swap. Be sure to
    persist the new state.

    ```

#### CLI OAuth2 App Example

This example shows authorisation, automatic token refreshing and API use in
a Django app which has read/write access to contacts and transactions.

Each time this app starts it asks for authentication, but you
could consider using the user `keyring` to store tokens.

```python
from xero import Xero
from xero.auth import OAuth2PKCECredentials
from xero.constants import XeroScopes

# Get client_id, client_secret from config file or settings then
credentials = OAuth2PKCECredentials(
    client_id, port=8080,
    scope=[XeroScopes.OFFLINE_ACCESS, XeroScopes.ACCOUNTING_CONTACTS,
            XeroScopes.ACCOUNTING_TRANSACTIONS]
)
credentials.logon()
credentials.set_default_tenant()

for contacts in xero.contacts.all()
    print contact["Name"]
```

### Older authentication methods ###

In the past, Xero had the concept of "Public", "Private", and "Partner"
applications, which each had their own authentication procedures. However,
they removed access for Public applications on 31 March 2021; Private
applications were removed on 30 September 2021. Partner applications
still exist, but the only supported authentication method is OAuth2; these
are now referred to as "OAuth2 apps". As Xero no longer supports these older
authentication methods, neither does PyXero.

## Using the Xero API

*This API is a work in progress. At present, there is no wrapper layer
to help create real objects, it just returns dictionaries in the exact
format provided by the Xero API. This will change into a more useful API
before 1.0*

The Xero API object exposes a simple API for retrieving and updating objects.
For example, to deal with contacts::

```python
# Retrieve all contact objects
>>> xero.contacts.all()
[{...contact info...}, {...contact info...}, {...contact info...}, ...]

# Retrieve a specific contact object
>>> xero.contacts.get(u'b2b5333a-2546-4975-891f-d71a8a640d23')
{...contact info...}

# Retrieve all contacts updated since 1 Jan 2013
>>> from datetime import datetime
>>> xero.contacts.filter(since=datetime(2013, 1, 1))
[{...contact info...}, {...contact info...}, {...contact info...}]

# Retrieve all contacts updated in the last week
>>> from datetime import datetime, timedelta
>>> xero.contacts.filter(since=(datetime.now() - timedelta(days=7)))
[{...contact info...}, {...contact info...}, {...contact info...}]

# Retrieve all contacts whose name is 'John Smith'
>>> xero.contacts.filter(Name='John Smith')
[{...contact info...}, {...contact info...}, {...contact info...}]

# Retrieve all contacts whose name starts with 'John'
>>> xero.contacts.filter(Name__startswith='John')
[{...contact info...}, {...contact info...}, {...contact info...}]

# Retrieve all contacts whose name ends with 'Smith'
>>> xero.contacts.filter(Name__endswith='Smith')
[{...contact info...}, {...contact info...}, {...contact info...}]

# Retrieve all contacts whose name starts with 'John' and ends with 'Smith'
>>> xero.contacts.filter(Name__startswith='John', Name__endswith='Smith')
[{...contact info...}, {...contact info...}, {...contact info...}]

# Retrieve all contacts whose name contains 'mit'
>>> xero.contacts.filter(Name__contains='mit')
[{...contact info...}, {...contact info...}, {...contact info...}]

# Create a new object
>>> xero.contacts.put({...contact info...})

# Create multiple new objects
>>> xero.contacts.put([{...contact info...}, {...contact info...}, {...contact info...}])

# Save an update to an existing object
>>> c = xero.contacts.get(u'b2b5333a-2546-4975-891f-d71a8a640d23')
>>> c['Name'] = 'John Smith'
>>> xero.contacts.save(c)

# Save multiple objects
>>> xero.contacts.save([c1, c2])
```

Complex filters can be constructed in the Django-way, for example retrieving invoices for a contact:

```python
>>> xero.invoices.filter(Contact_ContactID='83ad77d8-48a7-4f77-9146-e6933b7fb63b')
```

Filters which aren't supported by this API can also be constructed using 'raw' mode like this:
```python
>>> xero.invoices.filter(raw='AmountDue > 0')
```

Be careful when dealing with large amounts of data, the Xero API will take an
increasingly long time to respond, or an error will be returned. If a query might
return more than 100 results, you should make use of the ``page`` parameter::

```python
# Grab 100 invoices created after 01-01-2013
>>> from datetime import datetime
>>> xero.invoices.filter(since=datetime(2013, 1, 1), page=1)
```

You can also order the results to be returned::

```python
# Grab contacts ordered by EmailAddress
>>> xero.contacts.filter(order='EmailAddress DESC')
```

For invoices (and other objects that can be retrieved as PDFs), accessing the PDF is done
via setting the Accept header:

```python
# Fetch a PDF
invoice = xero.invoices.get('af722e93-b64f-482d-9955-1b027bfec896', \
    headers={'Accept': 'application/pdf'})
# Stream the PDF to the user (Django specific example)
response = HttpResponse(invoice, content_type='application/pdf')
response['Content-Disposition'] = 'attachment; filename="invoice.pdf"'
return response
```

Download and uploading attachments is supported using the Xero GUID of the relevant object::

```python
# List attachments on a contact
>>> xero.contacts.get_attachments(c['ContactID'])
[{...attachment info...}, {...attachment info...}]

# Attach a PDF to a contact
>>> f = open('form.pdf', 'rb')
>>> xero.contacts.put_attachment(c['ContactID'], 'form.pdf', f, 'application/pdf')
>>> f.close()

>>> xero.contacts.put_attachment_data(c['ContactID'], 'form.pdf', data, 'application/pdf')

# Download an attachment
>>> f = open('form.pdf', 'wb')
>>> xero.contacts.get_attachment(c['ContactID'], 'form.pdf', f)
>>> f.close()

>>> data = xero.contacts.get_attachment_data(c['ContactID'], 'form.pdf')
```

This same API pattern exists for the following API objects:

* Accounts
* Attachments
* BankTransactions
* BankTransfers
* BrandingThemes
* ContactGroups
* Contacts
* CreditNotes
* Currencies
* Employees
* ExpenseClaims
* Invoices
* Items
* Journals
* ManualJournals
* Organisation
* Overpayments
* Payments
* Prepayments
* Purchase Orders
* Receipts
* RepeatingInvoices
* Reports
* TaxRates
* TrackingCategories
* Users


## Idempotent Requests
Xero [supports idempotent requests](https://developer.xero.com/documentation/guides/idempotent-requests/idempotency)
to its API to prevent accidentally repeating actions when modifying data. PyXero accepts an `idempotency_key` keyword
argument on the following manager methods:
* put
* save
* put_history_data
* put_history
* put_attachment_data
* put_attachment

You can use any string up to 128 characters in length as an idempotency key, A helper function is provided to
generate strings according to Xero's recommended method of concatenating four UUIDs together (without hyphens).

```python3
from xero.utils import generate_idempotency_key

invoice = {
    "Type": "ACCPAY",
    "InvoiceNumber": "AB1234",
    "Contact": {
        "Name": "Joe The Plumber",
    },
}

# Performing the following request 3 times would create 3 draft bills in your Xero payables
xero.invoices.put(invoice)

# Performing the same request with an idempotency key 3 times will result in only 1 draft bill being created.
# The subsequent requests will return the same response as the first successful request with that key.
key = generate_idempotency_key()
xero.invoices.put(invoice, idempotency_key=key)

# Any reuse of the same key on a different request (such as the same request but using POST [save] instead of PUT)
# will raise a 400 Bad Request
xero.invoices.save(invoice, idempotency_key=key)   # Raises XeroBadRequest: None: No Message Provided
```


## Payroll

In order to access the payroll methods from Xero, you can do it like this:

```
xero.payrollAPI.payruns.all()
```

Within the payrollAPI you have access to:

* employees
* leaveapplications
* payitems
* payrollcalendars
* payruns
* payslip
* superfunds
* timesheets


## Projects

In order to access the projects methods from Xero, you can do it like this:

```
xero.projectsAPI.projects.all()
```

Within the projectsAPI you have access to:

* projects
* projectsusers
* tasks
* time


## Under the hood

Using a wrapper around Xero API is a really nice feature, but it's also interesting to understand what is exactly
happening under the hood.

### Filter operator

``filter`` operator wraps the "where" keyword in Xero API.

```python
# Retrieves all contacts whose name is "John"
>>> xero.contacts.filter(name="John")

# Triggers this GET request:
Html encoded: <XERO_API_URL>/Contacts?where=name%3D%3D%22John%22
Non encoded:  <XERO_API_URL>/Contacts?where=name=="John"
```

Several parameters are separated with encoded '&&' characters:

```python
# Retrieves all contacts whose first name is "John" and last name is "Doe"
>>> xero.contacts.filter(firstname="John", lastname="Doe")

# Triggers this GET request:
Html encoded: <XERO_API_URL>/Contacts?where=lastname%3D%3D%22Doe%22%26%26firstname%3D%3D%22John%22
Non encoded:  <XERO_API_URL>/Contacts?where=lastname=="Doe"&&firstname=="John"

```

Underscores are automatically converted as "dots":
```python
# Retrieves all contacts whose name is "John"
>>> xero.contacts.filter(first_name="John")

# Triggers this GET request:
Html encoded: <XERO_API_URL>/Contacts?where=first.name%3D%3D%22John%22%
Non encoded:  <XERO_API_URL>/Contacts?where=first.name=="John"
```

## Contributing

If you're going to run the PyXero test suite, in addition to the dependencies
for PyXero, you need to add the following dependency to your environment:

    mock >= 1.0

Mock isn't included in the formal dependencies because they aren't required
for normal operation of PyXero. It's only required for testing purposes.

Once you've installed these dependencies, you can run the test suite by
running the following from the root directory of the project:

    $ tox -e py

If you find any problems with PyXero, you can log them on [Github Issues](https://github.com/freakboy3742/pyxero/issues).
When reporting problems, it's extremely helpful if you can provide
reproduction instructions -- the sequence of calls and/or test data that
can be used to reproduce the issue.

New features or bug fixes can be submitted via a pull request. If you want
your pull request to be merged quickly, make sure you either include
regression test(s) for the behavior you are adding/fixing, or provide a
good explanation of why a regression test isn't possible.
